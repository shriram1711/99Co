Hi,

1- Created Controller,Service,Repository Structure.
2- Added PostMan collection to Verify the REST API's.
3- As per my understanding I have created the REST API's in all the 3 controller List,User and Public-API.
4- There is more that we can do like Database constraints, error message modification etc.
